// Create a class called time that has separate int member data for hours, minutes, and seconds. One constructor
// should initialize this data to 0, and another should initialize it to fixed values. Another member function should
// display it, in 11:59:59 format. The final member function should add two objects of type time passed as
// arguments.
// A main() program should create two initialized time objects (should they be const?) and one that isnâ€™t initialized.
// Then it should add the two initialized values together, leaving the result in the third time variable. Finally it should
// display the value of this third variable. Make appropriate member functions const.
